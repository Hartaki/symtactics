# Instructions

## OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES

In 2047, Hong Kong is in the midst of ever-growing inequality. Players Travel, Fight, and spend Resources to complete Interven­tions (i.e. "build stuff") at various sites across the geographic region of Hong Kong. A successful Intervention will help achieve a collective victory condition, counteract the effects of Uneven Growth Milestones, and double players' Resources.

Events, which happen at the beginning of every round, force the players to continually shift their tactical decisions and strate­gic objectives. There are three outcomes to the game:

### COLLECTIVE WIN: All Players win
- `Interventions` are complete
- before Time Track reaches The End 

### INDIVIDUAL WIN: 1 Player with the most Resources wins
- `Uneven Growth Milestones` have accumulated
- Current Round < The End 

### UNIVERSAL DEFEAT: All Players lose
- Time Track reaches The End 
- Before all `Interventions` or `Uneven Growth milestones` are completed.

## SETUP

### 1. PREPARE ELEMENTS

-   1 six-sided die
-   `ASUS Drone` (1)
-   `Player` (2-6)
-   `Vietnamese Refugees` (1)
-   `Time Track Counter` (1)
-   Shuffled deck of `Resources` + `Items`, as `Assets` (68)
-   Shuffled deck of `Mini-Newspapers` (16)

### 2. SET UP THE BOARD

- Roll die to choose the `Starting Player`
- Deal 3 `Assets` to every `Player`
- Place elements onto the board:
  - `ASUS Drone` on its hex
  - `Vietnamese Refugees` on its hex
  - `Players` on `Central` hex
  - `Mini-Newspapers` (face up) on `Hong Kong News`
  - `Time Track Counter` on `Game Start`
  -  Remaining `Assets` (face down) on `Draw Pile`
 
### 3. START GAME

Begin with `Starting Player`. Each `Player` takes 1 turn per `Round`. Move in a clockwise fashion. During their turn, a `Player` may perform any and all of the following actions once, in any order:

-   `DRAW` - Draw 1 `Asset` (if available)
-   `TRAVEL` 
        - The `Weather Forecast` in the `Mini-Newspaper` determines how `Players` may travel during the round.
        - Roll die. 
        - Travel up to the amount of the roll according to the `Weather Forecast`
        - The first time you enter an `Ocean` hex from a land hex, you must discard 1 `Asset` to continue travelling.
-   `FIGHT` - You may attack any `Player` in the same hex as you. 
        -   `Attacking Player` rolls die. 
        -   `Defending `Player` rolls die. 
        -   If `Attacking Player` roll > `Defending Player` roll:
            -   `Defending Player` gives 2 `Assets` to the `Attacking Player`
            -   `Defending Player` moves to `Central` hex 
        -   Else nothing happens 
-   `TRADE` - `Players` can Trade `Assets` with other `Players` at any time. Trades are negotiable: 1-for-1 or 2-for-1, etc.
-   `INTERVENE` - When you reach a site hex, you may stop there to perform an Intervention. Look at the Market to see what Resources are 'wild' and can stand for any other Resource for the duration of the round. Pay the 3 Resources from your hand that match the site's 3 icons and place them face-up on the bottom of the game board where noted. Draw 6 cards from the Draw Pile. You may also take a few moments to explain your Intervention to the other players and how it utilizes the required Resources to create a better urban condition at your site. If at least two of the other players agree that your description is compelling, you may Draw another card. You may not Travel further upon complet­ing an Intervention.
-   `DRAIN / DEVELOP` - If you're at a site with an Intervention, you can Drain it by taking the Resources from the bottom of the board. Further, you could Develop the site by reinvesting the drained Resources to draw 6 new cards from the Draw Pile.

**ASUS Drone**: If you roll a 6 to Travel or during a Fight, you gain control of the ASUS Drone. The Drone immedi­ately teleports into your current hex. Traveling on water does not affect its range. In addition to whatever actions you as a player choose to perform, you may perform one of the following Drone actions:

-   `DRONE STRIKE` - Attack another player up to a range of 3 hexes from you.
-   `DRONE RIDE` - Use the Drone to teleport you to any hex within a range of 3 from your current position.
-   `DRONE INTERVENTION` - Use the Drone to Intervene, to Drain or to Redevelop any site within a range of 3. Note that you must still possess the required Resources to do this.

**Vietnamese Refugees**: Go to this hex to rescue the Vietnamese Refugees. Put the token in your hand.

-   You may choose to reset all cards in the Discard Pile and move them back to the Draw Pile during any Rebalance. You can also hold them hostage.

### 4. MOVE TO THE NEXT ROUND

**AFTER ALL PLAYERS TAKE A TURN **
The Starting Player is responsible for moving the Time Track Counter forward every round.

**IN A ROUND **

1. Transfer the number of cards from the Discard Pile to the Uneven Growth Milestones equal to the current round (as indicated in roman numerals on the Time Track). Each Milestone can hold 3 discarded cards before the next slot starts filling up.
2. Read the Mini-Newspaper on the top of the pile. The Weather Forecast and Market affect all players' ability to Travel and spend Resources during this round. The Event is a chaotic global condition that will last for the duration of the entire round. The back page tells you what areas are affected by the Event.
3. Any player in the affected area must discard 2 Resource cards and place them into the Discard Pile. If a player has an Item corresponding to the Affected Area, she may use it to protect herself from the Event. Remove used Items from the game. Remove the Mini-Newspaper at the end of the round.

**IN A REBALANCE **

-   First, compare the number of Interventions to the com­pleted Uneven Growth Milestones. Only Interventions and Milestones with 3 cards are complete.
-   If Interventions are greater than or equal to Milestones, all players forfeit their hands and return the cards to the Draw Pile. 3 new cards are dealt to each player.
-   If Interventions are fewer than Milestones, the player with the most Resource cards takes 2 turns this round and controls the Drone for both turns.

**Next, follow same steps 1-3 in a Round. **
